# Bike Sales Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bike sales data across India using **Python** for data preprocessing and **Tableau** for data visualization. The goal is to uncover trends in bike sales based on various factors like brand, model, city tier, resale price, and engine capacity.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Identify the best-selling bike brands and models.
- Understand the relationship between price, mileage, and resale value.
- Analyze sales trends based on manufacturing year.
- Examine the impact of city tiers on sales distribution.
- Create interactive visualizations for better insights.

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of **10,000 rows** and includes the following features:
- `State` - Location of the sale.
- `Avg Daily Distance (km)` - Average distance traveled daily.
- `Brand` - Manufacturer of the bike.
- `Model` - Specific bike model.
- `Price (INR)` - Original price of the bike.
- `Year of Manufacture` - Year in which the bike was manufactured.
- `Engine Capacity (cc)` - Engine displacement of the bike.
- `Fuel Type` - Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/Electric).
- `Mileage (km/l)` - Fuel efficiency of the bike.
- `Owner Type` - First-hand, second-hand, etc.
- `Registration Year` - Year of registration.
- `Insurance Status` - Whether the bike has active insurance.
- `Seller Type` - Individual or dealer.
- `Resale Price (INR)` - Market value at resale.
- `City Tier` - Metro, Tier 1, or Tier 2 city.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau** – Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## 📊 Data Analysis & Insights
### 1️⃣ Sales Performance by Brand
- Brands like **Yamaha, KTM, and Royal Enfield** have strong sales.
- Higher resale price is observed for premium brands like **Kawasaki and Royal Enfield**.

### 2️⃣ City Tier Sales Breakdown
- Metro cities have a higher share of total bike sales compared to Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.
- Sales distribution remains consistent across different brands.

### 3️⃣ Yearly Sales & Average Price
- The average price of bikes has remained stable over the years.
- Sales volume slightly increases post-2020, indicating market growth.

### 4️⃣ Sales Distribution Across India
- States like **Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu** contribute significantly to bike sales.
- Northern and Western regions show higher demand compared to Eastern states.

### 5️⃣ Engine Capacity vs. Price
- Higher engine capacity bikes (>600cc) have significantly higher resale value.
- The **engine capacity and price are positively correlated**.
